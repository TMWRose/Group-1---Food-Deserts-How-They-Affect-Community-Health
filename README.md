# Group-1 Obesity Mortality Rate in Food Deserts

## Presentation
* Analysis of how food deserts can affect a communities diabetes/obesity mortality rate.
* We initially were going to focus on predicting if counties were food deserts or not based on countrywide zip codes, but that would have been a much bigger project than we could finish in 4 weeks, so we narrowed our focus to just diabetes. 
* Our data comes from the Food Atlas by the USDA and data we pulled from the MU study *“A ‘Big Data’ Approach to Understanding Neighborhood Effects in Chronic Illness Disparities.”*
* We are looking to predict the health of a county based on data from food deserts in Michigan.
