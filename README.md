# Group-2---Food-Deserts-How-They-Affect-Community-Health
Analysis of data from an MU study in Detroit about how food deserts affect a communitiesâ€™ health

## 7/30/2022

I wrote a short jupyter notebook to pair down the csv files into smaller pandas dataframes

there is also code in there to send the data into a sql database but that code will need to be modified a little bit to get it to work on your machines.

From the Large FoodEnviromental access dataset. 

places are designated by FIPS code, first two digits are for state, next tree digits are for county. there can be up to seven digits total to get down to the place level. Need connect this to the GEOIS10 code or county code feom the neighborhood effects health status table

we would be able to aggrigate everything down to the county level to match the food atlas set



from the food atlas we want the following columns
- ACCESS TABLE
