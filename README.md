# Group-1 Diabetes/Obesity Mortality Rates in Food Deserts

## Presentation
* Analysis of how food deserts can affect a cmmunities diabetes/obesity mortality rate.
* We initally were going to focus on predicting if counties were food deserts or not based on countrywide zipcodes, but that would have been a much bigger project than we could finish in 4 weeks so we narrowed our focus to just diabetes. 
* Our data comes from the Food Atalas by the USDA and data we pulled from the MU study *“A ‘Big Data’ Approach to Understanding Neighborhood Effects in Chronic Illness Disparities.”*
* We are looking to predict the health of the a county based on data from food deserts in Michigan.
